# ZooZ PHP Client
Presented here is a sample usage (index.php) and a full library for zooz.com's HTML5 payments.

## Library
The library variables on the top will have to be filled up with your own information. The first function is the opening function for both functions below - best not to edit that unless you know what you're doing.
There are more postfields that you can sent to the openTrx, see the advanced API for more details.

## Application
Applying the library is easy, simple require it on your page and call the function you need on the page you need it. The comments on the index.php should be sufficient to tell you how it's supposed to work.
